# php-ring-api
Unofficial PHP API client for the Ring.com doorbell. 

This is a very basic PHP client for the Ring.com (https://ring.com/) doorbell. It is able to connect to the ring.com server and poll for motion or dings (aka somebody pressed the button).

I'm in no way affiliated with Ring.com, these are just my personal experiments.
